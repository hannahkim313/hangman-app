// Main lib for pure game logic

// Pre-game logic:
// Wait until there are 2 players in the lobby
// Start countdown once both players are present
// Initialize players and game state (defined in /types)

// Game start logic:
// Select a random word (either from a pre-determined list or a custom function?)
// Track each player's guesses
// Each player guesses 1 letter at a time
// A player loses 1 life for an incorrect guess

// Game end logic:
// The game ends when (1) a player correctly guesses the word or (2) a player loses all 6 lives
